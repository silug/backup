NAME
    backup - automates copies of remote filesystems

SYNOPSIS
    backup [ <options> ]

DESCRIPTION
    This script is designed to take advantage of the fact that disk is
    cheap. The idea is to have a system with enough disk to make a duplicate
    of whatever data you care about.

    By default, this will be done filesystem-by-filesystem with rsync
    running over ssh, but the mechanism is flexible enough to back up just
    about anything.

OPTIONS
    --extraflags=*flags*
        Add *flags* to rsync (or whatever the backup command is set to).

        In the past, this was especially useful for occasionally running
        rsync with `--delete' (`--extraflags=--delete'), but now that this
        program saves backup copies of everything, that's part of the
        default command.

        To add multiple options, use `--extraflags="--option1 --option2"' or
        use `--extraflags' multiple times.

    --host=*host*
        Only backup *host*. (This can be used multiple times to backup
        multiple hosts.)

        The default is to backup all hosts.

    --maxchildren=*number*
        Backup up to *number* systems at once.

    --backupdir=*path*
        The script creates directories under *path* for each system.

    --configfile=*filename*
        Use *filename* for the config file. The default is /etc/backup.conf.

    --configdir=*path*
        Look for files describing what will be backed up under *path*. The
        default is /etc/backup.d.

        This script will look for directories named `monthly', `weekly',
        `daily', and `unscheduled' under this directory. The files must be
        under those directories.

    --verbose
        Makes rsync more verbose (equivalent to `--extraflags="--verbose
        --progress"'). In a future revision, it might also make this script
        a bit more verbose.

    --debug
        Spews lots of debugging information as the program runs. It might be
        useful when debugging problems, or it might not.

        This is equivalent to adding "debug=yes" to the config file.

    --timeout
        Sets the I/O timeout in seconds for rsync.

    --daily
        Run daily backups. This is the default if no hosts or other schedule
        (`--weekly' or `--monthly') are specified.

    --weekly
        Run weekly backups.

    --monthly
        Run monthly backups.

FILES
    /etc/backup.conf
        Configuration options can be given in this file in the form

            parameter = value

        debug
            Setting this option to "yes" is equivalent to adding --debug to
            the command-line.

        default command
            This can be used to specify an alternative default command.
            Certain special strings can be used, including `DEFAULT'. See
            "COMMANDS".

        backupdir
            This is equivalent to the --backupdir command-line option.

        maxchildren
            This is equivalent to the --maxchildren command-line option.

        configdir
            This is equivalent to the --configdir command-line option.

        timeout
            This is equivalent to the --timeout command-line option.

    /etc/backup.d/*
        Each host to be backed up should have a file under this directory.
        The file's name must be the name of the host to backup.

        The format of the file is

            /path/to/backup     command

        The command is optional.

COMMANDS
    Any commands to run specified in the configuration files will have the
    following substitutions performed on them:

    `DEFAULT'
        This will be replaced with the default command.

    `EXTRAFLAGS'
        This will be replaced with any flags specified with --extraflags on
        the command line.

    `HOST'
        This will be replaced with the name of the host being backed up.

    `PATH'
        This will be replaced with the path being backed up.

    All commands are run from the directory where backups for that host and
    filesystem should be stored.
